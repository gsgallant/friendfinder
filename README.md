#Comments

The original idea called for finding the first most compatible friend but I wasn't happy with that because I knew there would be many ties for compatibility as the database grew.  I decided to add a random choice among the ties and the app worked out well.  I seeded the database with all animal photos just for fun.

When I saw the photo that ended up as the background image, I knew I had the right styling.  It kind of makes me smile when looking at the two red M&M's - perfect friends!
